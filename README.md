# Covid-Policy-Analyzer

The COVID Policy Analyzer is an NLP-driven analytical system designed to study public sentiment and discourse around COVID-19 policies using social media data. The project focuses on understanding how people reacted to government policies during the pandemic by analyzing large volumes of tweets.

The system uses the Kaggle COVID-19 Tweets Dataset (India) and news from multiple news websites and applies comprehensive text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization. Machine learning and NLP models are then used to classify tweets into sentiment categories, providing insights into public opinion trends.

The analyzed sentiment data helps identify patterns in public response to lockdowns, healthcare measures, and policy changes, enabling data-driven evaluation of policy impact during the COVID-19 period.
